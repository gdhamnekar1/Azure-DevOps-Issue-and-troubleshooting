The error you're encountering:

```
(MissingSubscriptionRegistration) The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.KeyVault'
```

means your Azure subscription **has not been registered to use the Key Vault resource provider** (`Microsoft.KeyVault`).

---

### ‚úÖ Fix: Register the Key Vault resource provider

You can fix this by running the following command:

```bash
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault
```

After running this, give it **a minute or two**, then verify registration:

```bash
az provider show --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault --query "registrationState"
```

When the registration is complete, it will return:

```
"Registered"
```

---

### üîÅ Then, retry your command:

```bash
az keyvault create -n aks-demo-vinod -g ecommerce-demo -l eastus --enable-rbac-authorization
```

Let me know once registration is done or if you hit any other errors.
